    <p>This image demonstrates the power and the history that the Black community had in Harlem. Black
        Panthers branch in Harlem was the first to be formed outside of the original branch in California.
        The Black Panthers were given power to the community by providing black centered education, health programs,
        and housing programs. The Black Panthers started the free lunch program that we all know of today if you
        attended a
        a public school. The Black Panthers in Harlem were active from 1969 to 1970.

    <h1>History of Gentrification in Harlem</h1>
    <h5> Harlem has a rich history which started when African Americans started migrated north from the south. This will
        lead to what we now know as the
        Harlem Renissance. The Black community flourished during this time with music, poetry, literature, dance, art,
        fashion,
        theatre, and politics. For Instance, Malcolm X gave his speeches of Civil Rights in Harlem. In Harlem Apollo,
        you had acts like
        Ella Fitzgerals and Louis Armstrong. With community like this, how could it get gentrified.
        During the late 80s and early 90s, Harlem was percieved as a poor area. Harlem had bad policing that stemed from
        racism, poor educational systems,
        poor healthcare, and increase of the population in unemployment. In the early 1990s, Harlem slowly came back to
        redevelopment which lead to crimes in the area
        decreasing, better transportation services which influenced other people to live in Harlem. Due to Harlem
        improving, the prices of residence started to go up.
        Landlords started to find ways to increase the rent on their tenants. When the rent is controlled, the apartment
        would cost about $1000. While non-controlled rent
        can have the apartment costing $5000 a month. During 2000 to 2005, 32,000 African Americans moved out of Harlem
        because of the rent increase alone. During this time, 22,000
        White, Latinx and Asians moved in as residents.
