    <h5>
        This image demonstrates a day I was walking in Brooklyn in Flatbush which was predonminatly black in the past but now in 2022, most brownstones are 
        owned by white families which the image is suppose to exemplify. 
    </h5>
    <p> From 2000 to 2010, an increase of 6,700 to 15,6000 white people have moved into 
        neighborhoods that were predonimantly Black and Latino. This lead to the decrease of Black 
        and Latino residents. This is displacement which is when homes or apartments are being left by 
        residents that can not afford the high prices. Brooklyn natives are leaving due to the big increase in price, 
        facing harassments from tenants and witholding repairs for they can get tenats that pay higher. Black Brooklyn is known as 
        areas in Brooklyn that have majority of the African American population. These areas would include Fort Greene, Clintin Hill
        Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, Crown Heights, Ocean Hill, Canarsie,Flatlands, East Flatbush, Flatbush, some parts of Bushwick,
        and some parts of downtown Brooklyn.

       <h1>Results of the Study of 2010: Who gentrifies low-income neighborhoods?</h1>
       <p>
        During the 1990s to 2000s using data collection from thooe Census, researchers found that middle class black families gentrifies low class
        black families because of the neighborhood increased in value and there is racial diversity in the neighborhoods which means experiencing less
        microagressions and racism. There was a limitation to the study that the census couldn't exactly be precise in identifying gentrification.
